# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Camera Affordability Scanner is a revolutionary feature that allows users to point their camera at any item and receive instant feedback on whether they can afford it based on their current budget and spending patterns. This feature leverages VisionKit for object recognition and Apple's Foundation Models for intelligent affordability calculations, providing users with real-time purchase decision support while maintaining complete privacy through on-device processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a budget-conscious user, I want to point my camera at any item and immediately know if I can afford it, so that I can make informed purchase decisions in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the camera affordability scanner THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen camera interface with real-time object recognition
2. WHEN the user points the camera at an item THEN the system SHALL recognize the object and estimate its price category within 2 seconds
3. WHEN an object is recognized THEN the system SHALL calculate affordability based on current budget, remaining monthly allowance, and spending patterns
4. WHEN affordability is determined THEN the system SHALL display a clear yes/no decision with color-coded feedback (green for affordable, red for not affordable)
5. IF the item is affordable THEN the system SHALL show the impact on remaining budget and suggest optimal purchase timing
6. IF the item is not affordable THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternatives or savings goals

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all camera processing and AI analysis to happen on my device, so that my financial data and shopping habits remain completely private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera scanner processes an image THEN all object recognition SHALL be performed using on-device VisionKit
2. WHEN affordability calculations are made THEN all AI processing SHALL use Apple Foundation Models running locally
3. WHEN price estimation occurs THEN the system SHALL use on-device machine learning models without network requests
4. WHEN any data is processed THEN no financial information SHALL be transmitted to external servers
5. WHEN the feature is used THEN all temporary image data SHALL be cleared from memory immediately after processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user making purchase decisions, I want to quickly add affordable items to my budget tracking, so that I can seamlessly integrate the scanner with my expense management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an item is determined to be affordable THEN the system SHALL display a "Add to Budget" button
2. WHEN the user taps "Add to Budget" THEN the system SHALL pre-populate an expense entry with estimated price and detected category
3. WHEN adding to budget THEN the user SHALL be able to adjust the amount and category before confirming
4. WHEN the expense is added THEN the system SHALL update the current budget calculations and spending streak
5. WHEN the transaction is saved THEN the system SHALL return to the camera view for continued scanning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who wants to understand my spending capacity, I want to see detailed affordability information beyond just yes/no, so that I can make more nuanced financial decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an affordability result is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a slide-up card with detailed information
2. WHEN the detail card appears THEN it SHALL display current budget status, remaining monthly allowance, and category-specific budget impact
3. WHEN showing affordability details THEN the system SHALL indicate how the purchase affects daily spending limits
4. WHEN an item is not affordable THEN the system SHALL show how much the user needs to save or wait to afford it
5. WHEN multiple similar items are detected THEN the system SHALL provide comparative affordability analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with varying lighting conditions and environments, I want the camera scanner to work reliably in different settings, so that I can use it anywhere I shop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the scanner in low light THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust camera settings for optimal recognition
2. WHEN objects are partially obscured THEN the system SHALL still attempt recognition and indicate confidence level
3. WHEN no clear object is detected THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance on positioning and lighting
4. WHEN multiple objects are in frame THEN the system SHALL allow the user to tap on specific items for analysis
5. WHEN the camera view is active THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback for successful object detection

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants to learn from my shopping patterns, I want the scanner to improve its price estimates over time, so that affordability calculations become more accurate with use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds actual prices after scanning THEN the system SHALL use this data to improve future estimates
2. WHEN price estimates are made THEN the system SHALL consider user's historical spending patterns in similar categories
3. WHEN shopping in familiar locations THEN the system SHALL adjust estimates based on typical price ranges for that area
4. WHEN the user frequently shops for certain item types THEN the system SHALL become more accurate for those categories
5. WHEN price learning occurs THEN all improvements SHALL happen on-device without compromising privacy
